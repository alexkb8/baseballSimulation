README

My overall design includes an App class that starts the program,
a PaneOrganizer class that sets up the graphical component of the program, and 
a Game class that handles all logical components, user input, and the game 
animation. The Game class uses a series of buttons to go from different screens
for different functionalities of the program. With these various options, one 
can run simulated offensive games for teams specified by inputted players, 
play a game and use the Up and Left arrow keys to steal second or third, the
P key to pause, and the B key to bunt, generate an optimized lineup based on 
simulated games with all possible permutations of a lineup, and evaluate bunting
and stolen base decisions.
